Yesterday i tried to look at Flutter and i will defetly continue
today with this project and tried to repair an very old computer
again, but the setup has still not finished yet. Probably it works
this time to install a new OS.

I although learned about a new programming
language which is called `dafny`. The language is mostly used for
debugging and checking if a function really give the output, it should.
Pretty interresting tbh!

This is so scuffed omg, when i build exexcutables for Python
with `pyinstaller script.py` my Antivirus programm is always
detecting a virus while building the software, when i build
it in a VM and then check it on my PC, it wont detect anything.


i mean, WHY?!?

Anyway, i am a bit bored to be honest, i dont really now what
to code next! Probably i will make this website better and a
add more Stuff, maybe split this Blog into Articles with a
little description via a Markdown YAML Header. I really dont
know lol, i've to much Ideas XD

i could although add other font styles to the website, because
this really looks a bit scuffed, or add other sections with
other styles!

hmmm, or i could change the scroll bar with css, but i dont
really know how this is possible, but i think it is.

i have a new idea, i could although add a new Link Page to the
this website here!
