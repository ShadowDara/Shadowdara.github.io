# Devblog 001

## 06.05.2025

This is so scuffed omg, when i build exexcutables for Python
with `pyinstaller script.py` my Antivirus programm is always
detecting a virus while building the software, when i build
it in a VM and then check it on my PC, it wont detect anything.


i mean, WHY?!?

Anyway, i am a bit bored to be honest, i dont really now what
to code next! Probably i will make this website better and a
add more Stuff, maybe split this Blog into Articles with a
little description via a Markdown YAML Header. I really dont
know lol, i've to much Ideas XD

i could although add other font styles to the website, because
this really looks a bit scuffed, or add other sections with
other styles!

hmmm, or i could change the scroll bar with css, but i dont
really know how this is possible, but i think it is.


i have a new idea, i could although add a new Link Page to the
this website here!
