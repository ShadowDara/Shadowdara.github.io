# Devblog 005

## Develeping

Develeping Stuff very hard, and i am REALLY! The first problem is:

1. You need a good Idea want do you want to have
2. Then you need a point where you want to start with your Idea without
making a complete mess
3. Now you are at the point where you are realising that your Idea is
much more complicated then you thought before

to be honest, i really hate this process and i am although currently
learning how to make it easier without quitting and struggeling with
the project.
