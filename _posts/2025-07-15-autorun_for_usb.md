# Autorun File for USB Devices

This a code configgering USB-Sticks and running programms automatically with them

```ini
[autorun]
icon=Dara.ico
label="117GB"
open=start.bat
```

**Explanation**
- `icon` defines the used icon for the device in the explorer
- `label` is the used name of the device
- `open` is used to open a file, for example a `.bat` file *(but this feature is normally disabled now)*
