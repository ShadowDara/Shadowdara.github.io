# Devblog 003

## 22.05.2025

Again, i am really working on this website your are probably seeing
at the moment. I am really trying to make this as perfekt as i can,
maybe a bit to much, i am not sure, but it will be perfekt soon,
trust me!

I am again looking at Flutter. I really want to create my own OWN
mobile App, this would be so cool, but i dont have a good idea yet.

*sadly :(*

And i am trying to organisize my projects and Github Repositorys,
like writing TODO lists and stuff, to prevent the chaos.

I am although trying to live my life and not dying from stress :(

Very hard time at the moment to be honest, anyway

---

In Informatics class i started this week object orientated programming
in scala, to be honest, i am not really sure if i like this kind of
programming. This could be a bit messy if you do it wrong and i never
did it before.

And i dont like scala that much. This is really hard i think.

by the way, the articles not uploaded directly everytime, the date of
one article is more the written date then the publish Date.

### Bye
