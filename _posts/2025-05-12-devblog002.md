# 12.05.2025

Yesterday i tried to look at Flutter and i will defetly continue
today with this project and tried to repair an very old computer
again, but the setup has still not finished yet. Probably it works
this time to install a new OS.

I although learned about a new programming
language which is called `dafny`. The language is mostly used for
debugging and checking if a function really give the output, it should.
Pretty interresting tbh!
